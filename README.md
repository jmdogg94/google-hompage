Introduction:

This current project re creates the google hompage. the hompage will look like google but will not function like it. I will use the HTML code that I have learnt before to build the page. I will inspect the google hompage and look at the code to see how I can mimic it.

Reflection:

I completed this task spread over 2 days, spending around 2.5 hours on it each day. Im pleased with what I have achieved but I did struggle on the way. I managed to get all the content in html on my own, but some of the CSS I had to google. I copied some examples but I also learnt why they worked. It wasnt just a quick cheat, I was teaching myself by looking at their examples. I feel much more confident building websites not that this task is finished.
